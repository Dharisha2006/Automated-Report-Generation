# üìä Automated Report Generation

This project focuses on developing a robust Python script designed to automate the process of reading, analyzing, and generating formatted PDF reports from various data sources. It streamlines the reporting workflow, ensuring consistency and efficiency in data presentation.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

The core objective of this project is to create a fully automated system for report generation. The script is capable of ingesting raw data (e.g., from CSV, Excel, or other structured formats), performing necessary calculations or aggregations, and then compiling these insights into a professional, printable PDF document. This automation eliminates manual effort, reduces errors, and provides on-demand access to critical business information.

## üöÄ Features

* **Data Ingestion:** Reads structured data from specified input files.
* **Data Analysis:** Performs custom data processing, aggregation, and calculation based on reporting requirements.
* **PDF Report Generation:** Utilizes powerful Python libraries (`FPDF` or `ReportLab`) to create highly customizable PDF reports.
* **Formatted Output:** Ensures reports are well-structured with titles, tables, summaries, and potentially charts.
* **Automated Workflow:** Designed for hands-free execution to generate reports on demand or on a schedule.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Core Libraries:**
    * `pandas`: Essential for efficient data reading, manipulation, and analysis.
    * `fpdf` (or `ReportLab`): For generating PDF documents programmatically.
    * `os`: For file system operations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Running Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the automated report generation script on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed.
* `pip` (Python package installer).

### 2. Clone the Repository

If this script is part of a larger repository, navigate to that repository. Otherwise:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git)
cd YourRepoName # Replace YourRepoName with your actual repository name
3. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Bash

python -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install Dependencies
Bash

pip install pandas fpdf # If you use ReportLab, then `pip install reportlab` instead of `fpdf`
5. Prepare Input Data
Ensure your input data file (e.g., sales_data.csv, performance_metrics.xlsx) is placed in the same directory as the script, or update the script with the correct file path.
The script is designed to process data in a specific format; review the script's data reading section (pd.read_csv, pd.read_excel) to understand the expected structure.
6. Execute the Script
Run the main Python script from your terminal:

Bash

python generate_report.py # Replace `generate_report.py` with the actual name of your main script
Upon successful execution, a PDF report (e.g., report.pdf, Sales_Performance_Report.pdf) will be generated in the same directory.
